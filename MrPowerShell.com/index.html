<h1 id="hey-powershell-people">Hey PowerShell People!</h1>
<p>Welcome to a personal page from a PowerShell enthusiast.</p>
<h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h2>
<p>I'm James Brundage, and I've been using PowerShell since it's early days.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to help test and build PowerShell V2 and V3 at Microsoft,
and I've continued to do amazing things with the language ever since.</p>
<p>I enjoy making hard things easy to do, and I love to share my knowledge with others.</p>
<p>I'm always interested in interesting projects.</p>
<p>If you need the help of a Jack of all trades and master of PowerShell, reach out.</p>
